# BetterHomeDepotOffsetMaker
Simple little script to automatically generate offset files for BetterHomeDepot   
  
How to use: Open it in apple script editor or run it with osascript from Terminal.
This will place an errorlog "mkoffsets.log" on your Desktop as well as a *hopefully* functional offsets.json file

Note:
This script uses offsets from wall.supplies, MixtapePlayer's online offset lookup/ query service.
